      with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which

      <p>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of
      bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind 
      Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into 
      the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of 
      the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her 
      hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline 
      of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her 
      cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.</p>

      <p>The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would 
      have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its 
      origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn 
      around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said 
      could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy 
      Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her
      into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and 
      again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.</p>

      <address>Unga Bunga, July 26, 2016</address>
      
      <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found 
      himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his 
      armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his 
      brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
      The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any
      moment.</p>

      <p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of 
      him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he 
      thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a 
      little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.</p>

      <p>A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was
      a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had 
      recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded 
      frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat 
      upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm
      towards the viewer.</p>

      <p>Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of 
      rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. "How 
      about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he 
      thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to 
      sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that 
      position.</p>

      <p>However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to 
      where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that 
      he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he 
      began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before. "Oh,
      God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen!</p>

      <p>Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more 
      effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's 
      the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and 
      irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can 
      never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to
      Hell!</p>

      <p>He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his 
      back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found
      where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white 
      spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the 
      place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he 
      touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former 
      position. "Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes you 
      stupid. You've got</p>
