    <p><img src="images/grapes.png" alt="grapes icon">One morning, when Gregor 
    Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed 
    into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted 
    his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided 
    by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and 
    seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared 
    with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. 
    "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper
    human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four 
    familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table
    - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that 
    he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, 
    gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat 
    upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm 
    towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull 
    weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel 
    quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this 
    nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he 
    was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get 
    into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always 
    rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his 
    eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only 
    stopped when</p>
