        <p>Fixed design is how we originally started developing
        web pages.  Most content was static, there wasn't 
        much dynamic content (back in the days of dial-up
        Internet, some people didn't even download images
        by default, because they were so slow!)</p>
        
        <p>Fixed design used absolute size measurements, 
        such as points (pt), pixels (px), and even
        centimetres (cm), millimetres (mm) and inches (in)!
        Back then, people didn't have small mobile devices -
        everyone used a large laptop or desktop.  All the 
        screens we viewed things on were very large, but they
        had an aspect ratio of 4:3, so they were almost
        square.  Eventually, wider screens became popular,
        and people had more width to play with when designing
        web pages.</p>
        
        <p>With a fixed layout, your page didn't respond to 
        changes in viewport size, and certainly not to changes
        in orientation!  It's not like you could pick up your
        desktop monitor or laptop and tilt it to change the
        orientation like we can today with smaller devices!
        Thinking of that actually makes me laugh a little,
        and maybe you too, if you're over 35 :D</p>
        
        <p>This page uses a fixed layout, and I even designed
        it how I would have laid it out back in the days when
        people started using wider screens:  I design for the
        4:3 screen and add some decorative background for
        people that had a wider screen.  We didn't want to
        put content in that extra space, because then people
        with the 4:3 screens wouldn't see it!</p>
        
        <p>Try viewing this page in your browser the way
        you would normally view it on a wide screen, then 
        try resizing your screen to approximate a 4:3
        aspect ratio.  You can also try resizing your
        screen to the size of a tablet and/or smart phone:
        you'll notice that it's near impossible to
        use the page!</p>
        
        <p>Feel free to <a href="css/fixed.css">check 
        the external CSS file</a> I used
        for this page.  Notice that I even used the old
        style of laying out the page in HTML - using
        DIV elements instead of using the HTML5 semantic
        elements like HEADER, FOOTER, MAIN, etc.</p>
