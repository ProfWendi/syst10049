		  <p>Around 2014 more users were accessing web sites
		  via mobile browsers than with desktop browsers for
		  the very first time!  Mobile and small-device browsing
		  was now the norm, and no longer the exception.
		  For this reason, developers switched to a <strong>Mobile
		  First</strong> style of development: assuming that
		  the user was on a smaller device, and then adapting the
		  layout when a larger screen was detected.  Prior to 
		  this, developers did the opposite by develping for larger
		  devices and then "fixing" the layout if a smaller 
		  device was detected.  Mobile-First CSS made pages faster
		  because it targeted the larger mobile audience, so the
		  CSS didn't have to execute media queries to adjust for
		  the smaller screen size.  It also fit in perfectly with
		  Progressive Enhancement, since mobile-first technologies
		  were developed to ensure that a web site was still
		  usable even when these layouts were added and adjusted.
		  Furthermore, the idea that an element's styling should
		  always inherit from parent styling and never "undo" what
		  was already defined previoulsy in the cascade is also 
		  easy to maintain with Mobile First CSS.</p>
		  
		  <p><strong>Responsive</strong> design includes media queries
		  and the <strong>fluid
		  grids</strong> that could respond to changes in 
		  screen size and easily adjust layouts as necessary.
		  The CSS Flex Box and CSS Grid were two modules that
		  were added as fluid grids.  Developers could also
		  add properties to images to make "fluid images" that adjusted
		  easily with screen size and layout changes.</p>
		  
		  <p>This page uses a media query that's different
		  from the adaptive example: this time I assume
		  a single-column layout that works best on a mobile
		  device, and then when the screen is resized, it uses
		  CSS Flex Boxes and CSS Grids, depending on the size.</p>
		  
		  <p>As with the previous demonstrations,
		  try viewing this page in your browser the way
		  you would normally view it on a wide screen, then 
		  try resizing your screen to approximate a 4:3
		  aspect ratio.  You can also try resizing your
		  screen to the size of a tablet and/or smart phone.</p>
		  
		  <p>Feel free to <a href="css/resp.css">check  
		  the external CSS file</a> I used
		  for this page.  In the HTML I added an extra container
		  for this text content (there was a lot of debate over the proper 
		  use of the &lt;main> element, so I use it here as has finally 
	          been intended). 
		  I added two media queries to adapt the page for tablet size
		  and then for desktop size. The MAIN element is a column flexbox 
		  and, for desktop size, the second SECTION element is a CSS grid. 
		  I added a "grid-container" class to the last section to make
		  the CSS a bit more efficient, otherwise I was constantly 
		  using the selector "main > section:last-child" to access all the
		  child elements of the grid section.</p>
