      <p>Adaptive design arrived just in time: many
      users were visiting pages using smaller devices
      such as smart phones and tablets, and we needed
      a way to make the user experience just as good
      as if they were on a desktop or laptop computer.
      Before adaptive design, you would have to design
      2 of everything: For example, you'd have your
      regular index.html page that people would view,
      and near the top of the page you'd have a very
      clear link to the mobile version of that page,
      such as index_mobile.html.  You'd just have to 
      hope that mobile users saw the link and bookmarked
      the mobile version of the page.  It also meant
      that you had to update both versions of every
      page whenever something changed.  Yuck.</p>
      
      <p>Fluid design uses media queries to detect
      things like screen size and orientation, and then
      apply the appropriate CSS rules.  For example,
      you might have a menu appear in a column down
      the left side of the screen, but when the media
      query detected that the screen width reached
      a certain smaller size, it changed the CSS so
      that the menu moved into the main part of the
      document so there was only one column in the
      page's layout.  You can even have certain CSS
      rules change when a page is printed (I do this
      on my own notes pages: when the page is printed,
      I unhide all the hidden pages and expand all
      the items that are collapsed).</p>
      
      <p>We still sometimes used absolute and relative
      measurements with adaptive design: we often used
      pixels for things like margins, borders, and padding,
      and still preferred using em and % for font sizes.</p>
      
      <p>This page uses a media query: I defined
      my CSS to lay out the page as if it were a
      large screen, and then applied a different
      layout for small screens.</p>
      
      <p>As with the previous demonstration,
      try viewing this page in your browser the way
      you would normally view it on a wide screen, then 
      try resizing your screen to approximate a 4:3
      aspect ratio.  You can also try resizing your
      screen to the size of a tablet and/or smart phone.</p>
      
      <p>Feel free to <a href="css/adaptive.css">check 
      the external CSS file</a> I used
      for this page.  I redesigned the HTML to used
      the HTML5 semantic elements, since these were
      finally available when adaptive design became
      popular. I also got rid of the main container
      since, with adaptive design, it's no longer 
      needed.</p>
