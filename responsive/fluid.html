      <div class="main-content">
        <p>We started using fluid design so that our
        layouts could respond more to different screen
        sizes - this is still when everyone was using
        large laptop and desktop monitors.  When we
        had to start developing for mobile devices,
        we used fluid design but it wasn't very
        effective for smaller screens.</p>
        
        <p>Fluid design used percentages and ems to 
        size items relative to their containers and/or
        the viewport.  As a screen's size changed (we
        still didn't have the ability to change orientation
        for the first while), the items on the page
        would scale to match.  So an image that was set
        to 50% of the document body would always stay
        50% of the page, even when the screen grew or
        shrank.</p>
        
        <p>This page uses a fluid layout, so it adapts
        a bit better to changes from what was then the
        standard 4:3 screen to the newer, wider screens.
        It also adapts to very small screens that you
        might see on a tablet or smart phone - it's much
        easier to use than the fixed example, but 
        not perfect.</p>
        
        <p>As with the previous demonstration,
        try viewing this page in your browser the way
        you would normally view it on a wide screen, then 
        try resizing your screen to approximate a 4:3
        aspect ratio.  You can also try resizing your
        screen to the size of a tablet and/or smart phone.</p>
        
        <p>Feel free to <a href="css/fluid.css">check 
        the external CSS file</a> I used
        for this page.  Notice that I'm still using the old
        style of laying out the page in HTML - using
        DIV elements instead of using the HTML5 semantic
        elements like HEADER, FOOTER, MAIN, etc.</p>
